Talk about the way you run your race
Talk about the way you spit in my face
Talk about the resons why and the reasons you can't take that junt from my face
Talk about the way you run your life
Talk about the way you spin my head
Talk about the reasons and your seasons
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath yeah.
Just like the carnival you ride
Open up and step inside
Cross your heart and hope to die
You can fly
And if I lose my faith in you
I'm alive even though I'm suffocating
And if I lose my faith in you
I'm alive even though I'm suffocating
Talk about the way you live your live
Talk about the way you live in mine
Talk about the reasons why
And the reasons you can't take that junt from me
Talk about the way you run your ass
Talk about the way you speak the dead
Talk about the reasons and your seasons
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath.
Yeah
Just like a carnival you ride
Open up and walk inside
Ease your breath and lose your mind
You're so high.
