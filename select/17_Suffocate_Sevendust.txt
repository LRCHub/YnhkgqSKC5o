Hate all the blood on my hands
And the sins that bleed from my soul
Take it all away make it go away
Stand up for being
The last one to control
(But) What you can't see is being
The last one to know
[Chorus]
Fade into a dream
Try and save me from myself now
Save me from myself now
Fallen from the world
If I could ever breath in the
Air maybe then I wouldn't suffocate
Face all the things that were
Real to me long ago to save my
Name I never thought it would
Be such a long way to fall
[Chorus]
