[00:09.01] I could take every fuckin' word she said
[00:12.25] Throw it in her face
[00:14.75] Would she even care?
[00:18.33] Well, I still remember when she looked at me
[00:21.68] A frown upon her face
[00:24.24] Trying to be sincere
[00:34.24] 
[00:28.09] Well, I gathered all those little things she said
[00:31.42] Kept them close to me
[00:33.94] Trying to make this real
[00:37.58] This cloud will always hover over me
[00:41.05] I'm leaving you today
[00:43.23] 'Cause now I see
[00:51.23] 
[00:48.13] Suffocate, you suffocate
[00:52.08] That you lie (I don't lie)
[00:54.65] That you're fake (I'm not fake)
[00:57.65] Suffocate, you suffocate
[01:01.47] You always take (I don't take)
[01:04.02] What you can (what I can)
[01:16.52] 
[01:06.42] I could take every fuckin' game you played
[01:09.91] Blow it all away
[01:12.24] Would you even care?
[01:15.97] I could take all those lies you said to me
[01:19.32] Never go away, never disappear
[01:25.62] This cloud will always hover over me
[01:28.83] I'm leavin' you today
[01:31.11] 'Cause now I see
